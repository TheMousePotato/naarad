We hope your mid-semester exams went well.\n\nAs the library site was down for most part of mid-semester exams, our site MFQP was also rendered to be down for the first few days, but we found a way out so that we could keep serving papers to everyone in KGP! Now, let's all contribute, and increase the papers MFQP has. Our Paper Collection Drive starts today! We request everyone to submit their mid-semester question papers.\n\nHere's how you can contribute - Click, Upload & Send.\n\n1. Take a picture of your question paper\n2. Write Subject Code in email\n3. Send to metakgp-qp@googlegroups.com\n\nAnd, do visit http://metakgp.github.io/mfqp-source/ \n\nNever go to an exam without having had a look at the previous year's paper! Let's all work towards achieving that goal.\n\nThat's all folks! Have a nice week ahead!", "story": "Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur shared Metakgp's post.", "id": "149405445074499_1418561228158908", "pic": null, "link": "http://metakgp.github.io/mfqp-source/", "created_time": "2016-09-27T03:04:23+0000"}, {"message": "Only 20 minutes to a meal, safely sizzling up to 550\u00b0F, the GoSun Stove is the first truly practical fuel-free cooking solution.", "id": "149405445074499_373017949753437", "created_time": "2016-09-26T22:15:30+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/gosun-stove-portable-high-efficiency-solar-cooker/", "pic": null}, {"message": "Only 20 minutes to a meal, safely sizzling up to 550\u00b0F, the GoSun Stove is the first truly practical fuel-free cooking solution.", "id": "149405445074499_373017949753437", "created_time": "2016-09-26T22:15:30+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/gosun-stove-portable-high-efficiency-solar-cooker/", "pic": null}, {"message": "Only 20 minutes to a meal, safely sizzling up to 550\u00b0F, the GoSun Stove is the first truly practical fuel-free cooking solution.", "id": "149405445074499_373017949753437", "created_time": "2016-09-26T22:15:30+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/gosun-stove-portable-high-efficiency-solar-cooker/", "pic": null}, {"message": "Only 20 minutes to a meal, safely sizzling up to 550\u00b0F, the GoSun Stove is the first truly practical fuel-free cooking solution.", "id": "149405445074499_373017949753437", "created_time": "2016-09-26T22:15:30+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/gosun-stove-portable-high-efficiency-solar-cooker/", "pic": null}, {"message": "ODiN, innovative electro-optical mouse that starts your experience anew.", "id": "149405445074499_371390159916216", "created_time": "2016-09-24T22:07:17+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/odin-worlds-first-projection-mouse/", "pic": null}, {"message": "ODiN, innovative electro-optical mouse that starts your experience anew.", "id": "149405445074499_371390159916216", "created_time": "2016-09-24T22:07:17+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/odin-worlds-first-projection-mouse/", "pic": null}, {"message": "ODiN, innovative electro-optical mouse that starts your experience anew.", "id": "149405445074499_371390159916216", "created_time": "2016-09-24T22:07:17+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/odin-worlds-first-projection-mouse/", "pic": null}, {"message": "ODiN, innovative electro-optical mouse that starts your experience anew.", "id": "149405445074499_371390159916216", "created_time": "2016-09-24T22:07:17+0000", "link": "http://www.hopeforeverybody.com/odin-worlds-first-projection-mouse/", "pic": null}, {"message": "https://m.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "story": "NH Shohagh shared a page to Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur's Timeline.", "id": "149405445074499_297683893945934", "pic": null, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "created_time": "2016-09-24T19:14:48+0000"}, {"message": "https://m.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "story": "NH Shohagh shared a page to Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur's Timeline.", "id": "149405445074499_297683893945934", "pic": null, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "created_time": "2016-09-24T19:14:48+0000"}, {"message": "https://m.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "story": "NH Shohagh shared a page to Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur's Timeline.", "id": "149405445074499_297683893945934", "pic": null, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/BDsmart-fashion-1187229791349344/", "created_time": "2016-09-24T19:14:48+0000"}, {"message": "Technology Students' Gymkhana Presents OPEN IIT POSTERING !!\nDate: 25th September , Time : 2pm-5pm\nVenue: S-302\nPS: Contact your hall Gsec Socult about the rules for the event.\nSome basic rules for the event are:\n1.
