The proposed ideas, once implemented, will hopefully push us to the top among the more technologically advanced,efficient and passenger-friendly railway networks. \n\n12 Research projects have been awarded to IIT KGP with synergies between the metallurgical, civil, mechanical, chemical, electrical, and electronics and electrical communications departments being the focal point of the plan. The unique Rubber Technology Centre also has a crucial part to play in this project (for those you know who don't know, yes this is a legitimate place in our campus which does legitimate work).A lot of these research projects are in the final stages of testing. \n\nLet's hope to see our institute shoulder the responsibility of tackling many other pressing issues and live up to our motto.\n\nFor further details, please follow the link below:\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-kharagpur-works-on-projects-to-strengthen-rail-safety-3051841/", "pic": null, "created_time": "2016-09-27T16:15:40+0000"}, {"link": null, "id": "156819310131_10154443323545132", "message": "Open IIT || Debate 16-17\nGold : Mithilesh Pinjarkar\nSilver : Kaustav Brahma\nBronze : Abhinav Sharma and Vibhu Narayan Deo\n\nTeam ScholsAve congratulates all the winners and participants for putting up an exciting performance.", "pic": null, "created_time": "2016-09-27T12:31:41+0000"}, {"link": null, "id": "156819310131_10154443323545132", "message": "Open IIT || Debate 16-17\nGold : Mithilesh Pinjarkar\nSilver : Kaustav Brahma\nBronze : Abhinav Sharma and Vibhu Narayan Deo\n\nTeam ScholsAve congratulates all the winners and participants for putting up an exciting performance.", "pic": null, "created_time": "2016-09-27T12:31:41+0000"}, {"link": null, "id": "156819310131_10154443323545132", "message": "Open IIT || Debate 16-17\nGold : Mithilesh Pinjarkar\nSilver : Kaustav Brahma\nBronze : Abhinav Sharma and Vibhu Narayan Deo\n\nTeam ScholsAve congratulates all the winners and participants for putting up an exciting performance.", "pic": null, "created_time": "2016-09-27T12:31:41+0000"}, {"story": "The Scholars' Avenue shared Metakgp's post.", "id": "156819310131_10154441455365132", "pic": null, "message": "<b>The Scholars' Avenue shared Metakgp's post.</b>\n\nGreetings, fine citizens of the realm!

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department.\nMany a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence. Around 12% of our population do not know how does it feel to spend nights with lights! \n\nWe, from Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur urge each one of us to please use the electricity and water judiciously and encourage our friends towards the same.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department.\nMany a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness.
