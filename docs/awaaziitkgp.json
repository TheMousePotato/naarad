Sometimes shaky, sometimes steady. But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

In semifinal, they made a mockery of it by winning it with a score of 10-2.\nIn finals, they were lagging behind with a score of 2-3. And not to forget, they were two times defending champions! Chips were down. The chances of winning the gold again looked bleak. But that's exactly when they bounced back in style to make a stunning comeback and levelled the score! It went down to penalties. They were still in the game and did a brilliant job by holding the opposition on tie, given that opposition had one of the best goalkeepers of the tournament. It then went down to 'sudden death' and they lost it by just a whisker!\nDoes the story end here? No, certainly not! They gave it their everything, every ounce of energy that their body had, every drop of sweat that they could have offered and showcased indomitable will, grit, determination and strength! It was the culmination of hours long practice sessions and rigorous training schedules.\nAnd it's not only the Water Polo team, it has been the same with all other members of our contingent. They all have tried their best and left no stones unturned in bringing laurels to KGP. Be it silver or bronze or even no medal, it's not the medals for which they deserve applause, it's their sincere efforts that deserves tonnes of pats on their backs! \nLet's take a moment and appreciate what they have achieved and accomplished.

The next round is scheduled for September 24th.\n\n1) Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours)\nWe've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming Code Jam Kickstart (CJK) rounds. Even if you do not plan to participate in the upcoming rounds, the codelab should help brush up basics for other algorithmic contests and interviews. \n\nFor the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours.\n\n2) Sign-up for the Codelab by 20th Sep\nPlease sign-up via this form ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuYa3JLlJPSd7xkyVpflIwiqwjsg9TPo9WSCenthdDEG6nQ/viewform ) and we will send you the codelab material via email.

The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls.\n\nMS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the third position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category.\n\nWith the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

Under the Institute of Eminence scheme, 10 select government institutes will be given approximately Rs 1,000 crores. \"The finance ministry has suggested that the IITs should compete for that scheme instead of expecting funds through the Vishwajeet project,\u201d an official said.\nSource: http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earn-it-don-t-expect-it-govt-junks-funding-project-to-iits-instead-says-compete-for-grant/story-NZCMnzbs3y2niSfLe17abK.html", "link": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earn-it-don-t-expect-it-govt-junks-funding-project-to-iits-instead-says-compete-for-grant/story-NZCMnzbs3y2niSfLe17abK.html", "id": "146188872068143_1587076234646059", "created_time": "2017-09-07T06:25:00+0000"}, {"pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000"}, {"pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000"}, {"pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000"}, {"pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) | 25/25\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) | 24.5/25\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) | 22.5/25\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000"}, {"pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21319130_1586280324725650_4532057538525125414_o.jpg?oh=01a788df31d3c9deb0c2771c24d9e899&oe=5A4D6226", "message": "The Times Higher Education (THE) rankings 2018 of the world\u2019s top 1,000 universities in 77 countries was published yesterday and didn't pan out well for Indian institutions.
