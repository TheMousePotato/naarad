There were many happy and curious faces ready for the adventurous event. The theme of the event was based on Pokemon. Photos show the excitement and enthusiasm among the freshers. Even Lord Indra was not able to beat the tempo of freshers. \nInterestingly it's not the first time that it has rained on the day of an event. It has become quite a ritual of raining on days of special events in Kgp.", "pic": "1206815839338769.png", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1206815839338769/?type=3", "created_time": "2016-09-04T13:07:25+0000"}]
