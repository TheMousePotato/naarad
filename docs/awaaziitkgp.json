Same goes for IIT Patna with Rs. 8.36 crores.\n\n3) Avoidable expenditure towards penal charges on electricity consumption: IIT Madras had incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.05 crores towards penalty for exceeding contracted demand during April 2013 to March 2016 due to non-review and enhancement of sanctioned demand.\n\n4) Irregular waiver of overpayment: The Board of Governors of IIT Jodhpur irregularly waived recovery of excess payment amounting to Rs. 59.38 lakhs made to its faculty, which is now under recovery at the instance of Audit.\n\n5) Irregular reimbursement of LTC (Leave Travel Concession) claims by Central Autonomous Bodies: Central Autonomous Bodies irregularly reimbursed air fares of Rs. 6.90 crores during 2012-16 against the air tickets purchased by their employees from unauthorised agents in violation of the MoF guidelines for availing Leave Travel Concession. IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.
