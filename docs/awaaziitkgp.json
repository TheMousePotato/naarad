I have personally thanked our Director, IIT Kharagpur for being the part of the Open House session till the end and helping us resolve all the facts.\n\nWe had several meetings with different stakeholders to have an immediate action plan for our problems and prepared a thorough list of solutions. The attached action plan contains the suggestions of ours and the Director. I have tried to give few insights in each of the step giving you more clarity on the same.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nThe following points are references to the pdf attached. Kindly go through following points after going through pdf.\n\n1) As asked by few students in the Open House session, the Director has agreed for the external inquiry to be set up. He has himself talked to a retired judge of High Court for the same. However, on expressing concern from our side regarding the problems students involved in the event may face, the Director assured by saying that it will be tried to reduce the friction as much as possible.\n2) For the medical audit of BCRTH an expert committee will be appointed in 15 days, panel which would consist of about 2 male and 1 female doctor. We are expecting the audit to be done by the end of December.\n3) A complain portal with a complain escalation mechanism is being prepared. The basic feature of the complain portal will be prepared by us which would then be reviewed and improvised by the B C Roy Technology authorities. We are expecting the portal to be implemented by next week.\n4) Digitalization of B C Roy Hospital: We have proposed to make all the process of a normal visit of a student to BCRTH digitalized. This will include taking an appointment online, making a student's profile containing all the details of previous visits. Digitalization will remove all the ledger related work and will involve the least paper work. We are also trying to incorporate this in ERP helping students in a systematic approach towards the health issues. It will take about 3 months for the finalization.\n5) BCRTH has been stocked with certain life-saving items like anti-venom, anti-rabies etc and other items like clothes to be reviewed in one week. It has been done to equip the hospital 24*7 prepared to tackle few emergency issues.\n6) Regarding the public statement from the Institute, the Director has shared the Open House video from his personal Facebook page.\n7) We are taking a lot of initiatives by conducting several events for mental well being and also training G Sec Student Welfare Council, TSG and Student Welfare Group. For the same, an annual calendar list will be prepared and will be followed every year.\n8) A Dean's Council is being formed to assist Dean, SA and to tackle more student affairs.\n9) For a better fire emergency solutions, a plan is being developed by the security to have fire drill and checking the quality of extinguishers.\n10) One Annual Health Checkup (not mandatory) whose expenses will be integrated with medical insurances.\n11) Tie-ups with Railway hospitals are being made to handle more cases locally.\n12) A framework will be planned by December to develop a regulatory mechanism to assess the performance of BCRTH and Counselling Centre throughout the year.\n13) One Extra Academic Activity to be incorporated in already existing EAA system, National Cultural Organization. Technology Students' Gymkhana in association with SANDHI and Happiness Centre will be working on the same.\n\nStatus of ongoing action items have also been listed in the pdf. I urge you all to stay concerned about the progress of these points as they are of dire need, I will be more than happy to update you about any further development (ping me anytime).

I have personally thanked our Director, IIT Kharagpur for being the part of the Open House session till the end and helping us resolve all the facts.\n\nWe had several meetings with different stakeholders to have an immediate action plan for our problems and prepared a thorough list of solutions. The attached action plan contains the suggestions of ours and the Director. I have tried to give few insights in each of the step giving you more clarity on the same.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nThe following points are references to the pdf attached. Kindly go through following points after going through pdf.\n\n1) As asked by few students in the Open House session, the Director has agreed for the external inquiry to be set up. He has himself talked to a retired judge of High Court for the same. However, on expressing concern from our side regarding the problems students involved in the event may face, the Director assured by saying that it will be tried to reduce the friction as much as possible.\n2) For the medical audit of BCRTH an expert committee will be appointed in 15 days, panel which would consist of about 2 male and 1 female doctor.

The basic feature of the complain portal will be prepared by us which would then be reviewed and improvised by the B C Roy Technology authorities. We are expecting the portal to be implemented by next week.\n4) Digitalization of B C Roy Hospital: We have proposed to make all the process of a normal visit of a student to BCRTH digitalized. This will include taking an appointment online, making a student's profile containing all the details of previous visits. Digitalization will remove all the ledger related work and will involve the least paper work. We are also trying to incorporate this in ERP helping students in a systematic approach towards the health issues. It will take about 3 months for the finalization.\n5) BCRTH has been stocked with certain life-saving items like anti-venom, anti-rabies etc and other items like clothes to be reviewed in one week. It has been done to equip the hospital 24*7 prepared to tackle few emergency issues.\n6) Regarding the public statement from the Institute, the Director has shared the Open House video from his personal Facebook page.\n7) We are taking a lot of initiatives by conducting several events for mental well being and also training G Sec Student Welfare Council, TSG and Student Welfare Group. For the same, an annual calendar list will be prepared and will be followed every year.\n8) A Dean's Council is being formed to assist Dean, SA and to tackle more student affairs.\n9) For a better fire emergency solutions, a plan is being developed by the security to have fire drill and checking the quality of extinguishers.\n10) One Annual Health Checkup (not mandatory) whose expenses will be integrated with medical insurances.\n11) Tie-ups with Railway hospitals are being made to handle more cases locally.\n12) A framework will be planned by December to develop a regulatory mechanism to assess the performance of BCRTH and Counselling Centre throughout the year.\n13) One Extra Academic Activity to be incorporated in already existing EAA system, National Cultural Organization. Technology Students' Gymkhana in association with SANDHI and Happiness Centre will be working on the same.\n\nStatus of ongoing action items have also been listed in the pdf. I urge you all to stay concerned about the progress of these points as they are of dire need, I will be more than happy to update you about any further development (ping me anytime).

We identified his to be a unique standpoint having closely seen both incidents people have been talking about. However, we were unable to frame our interaction to portray the same intention. By no means was that document a hidden threat against protests, a way to shift blame or even an attempt to absolve the status of B.C. Roy\u2019s facilities.

Limiting the session to only B.C.R.H and Counseling Centre\nTo fulfil the objective of getting concrete solutions and directed answers, it is extremely necessary to keep asking questions that are on point. Diversifying the topic might lead to the focus being shifted, or people getting lost in the conversation. We will have other similar sessions in the future to tackle other issues. We hope you will show similar fervour towards them as well. \n\n6. Action plan \nThe student community is filled with anger and sorrow. It is important to channel these emotions productively. We plan to use this session to put up our demands. The administration is given an ultimatum to come up with the solutions, and the plan for implementation.

And when someone finally came to clean up the wound, they were harsh and gave me a lecture having disturbed their sleep.\nAnother time, during the vacations, I had stitches in my ear which I requested to be checked and removed when ready. The removal was postponed by almost a week saying my wound hasn't healed which resulted in my wound getting septic due to inadequate cleaning. The stitch removal process in the septic state was extremely painful and when requested for a surface anaesthetic, I was told that it was a long procedure for allowance. So, I should \"MAN UP\".\n\nExperience 2:\nI was suffering from viral fever and the medicines prescribed by the initial examination couldn't cure me. As it worsened, I was hospitalised after 10 days. In the hospital, I was given high dosages of antibiotic (1000 mg) along with saline drip regularly. This was the first time I was given a drip (completely unnecessary).\nAfter 2 days, my condition worsened with my temperature reaching up to 103 F.

My parents arrived the very next morning and I forcefully got myself discharged and taken to my hometown. I was there given no antibiotic, just some Vicks tablet and Dabur Honitus as the infection was in my throat which the BC Roy doctors couldn't find out. I became completely fine and came back to college in 5 days.\n\nExperience 3:\nI have a disease called migraine. Once, I reached B.C. Roy with a major attack of migraine and at the same time, they were handling a critical case of some other person. I was crying like anything. No one was ready to take my complaint while I literary cried in front of them. But no one was helping me, may be due to that critical case. I didn't want doctors to pay attention towards me instead of that critical case but I wanted them to have a sufficient number of emergency doctors to treat 12,000 KGPians.\n\nExperience 4:\nDuring my second year, I and my friend met with an accident. We went to the hospital late night and the doctor who was on the night shift in the emergency section said this to us - \"Yeh koi time hai aane ka\" **Is this a proper time to come to the hospital?** Later, after getting an X-ray, I got to know that I might be having a fracture on scaphoid bone. He wanted to confirm. So, he recommended 'another' X-ray and told me to come after a week because he won't be available.

Whether ovulating or bleeding, struggling with pre-menstrual syndrome or conception, our bodies, energy levels, sense of self, even our abilities are constantly shifting each and every day. And yet, nobody talks about it \u2013 a taboo among more mundane and everyday topics. The myths, such as, a menstruating woman is dirty and impure, that she cannot worship, that when she touches a tree, it wilts and that can she cannot lead a normal life during that phase are baseless, for it\u2019s not the inner you but only the biology that is changing. Let us accept that menstrual blood is pure, sacred and respect women for being blessed with the power to give birth.\nAs Manu from Hindu Mythology says in Manusmriti, \u201cYatra Naryastu Pujyante, Ramanti Tatra Devtaha, Yatraitaastu Na Pujyante, Savastatra Afalaha Kriyaha\u201d\nWhich means \u2018the divine are extremely happy where women are respected, but where they are not, all actions, however good and holy, are fruitless\u2019. Let's talk about menstruation freely, not as if it's a taboo and let the flower of fertility blossom.", "created_time": "2017-10-23T15:10:30+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1629083783778637/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22712558_1629083783778637_7333621216504935149_o.jpg?oh=f17ed054480ca6b260b5b3979ec5fb83&oe=5A7CC016", "id": "146188872068143_1629084173778598", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 4 new photos.", "message": "Just a few days ago, IIT Kharagpur\u200b saw best of the Rangolis on the occasion of Diwali celebrations.

The questions were already being raised about the steps taken by the administration to curb the suicides after the campus saw 4 suicides on a trot in the campus last semester but today's incident unearths and points out towards some serious and major loopholes in the existing setup. \n\nFor the reasons understandable, we will not be mentioning any names here.\n\nAs per the information that we have got, the attempt of committing suicide took place around 10:50 am today in LBS hall when the student jumped from the 4th floor of the hall building. He was not a resident of LBS hall of residence. As soon as people found out, they called the ambulance. So, he was soon taken to the hospital in the ambulance. On seeing the student\u2019s condition, BC Roy Technology Hospital referred him to Kolkata.  The ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm in the noon after completing all the paperwork where the student accompanying him was asked to get the signatures of the warden and a lot of other paperwork which almost took 40 minutes. In the meantime, there was a problem with the lights of the ambulance. So, another ambulance was called. Also, there was another delay of almost 10-15 minutes as the attendant was out of reach. During this time, as the pulse was near zero, the hospital people gave some injections and initial treatment to stabilize his pulse to 40-50.

The ambulance was accompanied by 2 escorts to Kolkata. Two of his friends with the Hall Manager, two attendants, and the doctor were in the ambulance.

After a while and a lot of efforts of the students and the policeman accompanying them, a Tata Ace owner agreed to take them to the hospital. As soon as the additional SP and the Director got this news, they informed the hospital at the other end and an ambulance was started in a reverse way to attend the case, but as the ambulance came to the spot, they saw nobody and they got information that they have left using some other source.

Therefore, results for the Illumination category haven't been declared.\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratultes each and every member of the KGP community who, despite the adversities, made this celebration a grand success!", "created_time": "2017-10-19T18:58:38+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1625483590805323"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/videos/1624414987578850/", "pic": null, "message": "\"It takes years of hard work to build a tradition like Illumination, but it takes nothing to let it decay into the oblivion\", that's what Prof. Somesh Kumar (Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Kharagpur) said when asked about Illumination.

For KGP, Illu is Diwali and Diwali is Illu. For the freshers who will be going to witness this trademark celebration of Diwali for the first time, they must be feeling intrigued when they find the air buzzing with \u2018illu\u2019. They must be having such questions in their mind like what is it? What\u2019s so special about it? What for our seniors are working so hard? is that effort worth it? And all. As the campus media body of IIT KGP, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur feels that the tale of this unique tradition must be passed on to the newcomers.

Each model had about 36-46 cubes of 10 cm sides which were joined to form the Illumination.\nThe project was supervised by Teaching Assistants Mr. Deepanjan Saha and Ms. Vidhu Vinod Bhushan.\n\nWe appreciate this unique and monumental effort of the students and believe that it will take the 'Illumination' culture to new heights!", "created_time": "2017-10-18T12:42:27+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1623596327660716/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499175_1623596327660716_6209690141452452934_o.jpg?oh=b354f59c23588ab6d714eb1dca16e4f5&oe=5A865E70", "id": "146188872068143_1623515071002175", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 7 new photos.", "message": "Haven't you got into the groove of 'Diwali' celebrations yet?

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

The next round is scheduled for September 24th.\n\n1) Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours)\nWe've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming Code Jam Kickstart (CJK) rounds. Even if you do not plan to participate in the upcoming rounds, the codelab should help brush up basics for other algorithmic contests and interviews. \n\nFor the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours.\n\n2) Sign-up for the Codelab by 20th Sep\nPlease sign-up via this form ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuYa3JLlJPSd7xkyVpflIwiqwjsg9TPo9WSCenthdDEG6nQ/viewform ) and we will send you the codelab material via email.

The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls.\n\nMS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the third position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category.\n\nWith the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

Under the Institute of Eminence scheme, 10 select government institutes will be given approximately Rs 1,000 crores. \"The finance ministry has suggested that the IITs should compete for that scheme instead of expecting funds through the Vishwajeet project,\u201d an official said.\nSource: http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earn-it-don-t-expect-it-govt-junks-funding-project-to-iits-instead-says-compete-for-grant/story-NZCMnzbs3y2niSfLe17abK.html", "created_time": "2017-09-07T06:25:00+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1587076234646059"}, {"link": null, "pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"link": null, "pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"link": null, "pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"link": null, "pic": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) | 25/25\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) | 24.5/25\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) | 22.5/25\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1586280324725650/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21319130_1586280324725650_4532057538525125414_o.jpg?oh=01a788df31d3c9deb0c2771c24d9e899&oe=5A4D6226", "message": "The Times Higher Education (THE) rankings 2018 of the world\u2019s top 1,000 universities in 77 countries was published yesterday and didn't pan out well for Indian institutions.

This, if implemented, is surely expected to cause a huge turnaround in the field of engineering education.\n\nSource: https://www.thequint.com/education/2017/07/26/three-internships-mandatory-for-engineering-students-says-javadekar", "created_time": "2017-07-26T17:04:40+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1548916871795329"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548768801810136/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20280558_1548768801810136_7141820035001077593_o.jpg?oh=caefa5ce071a318ef098550254f9d6d1&oe=59FDC2EE", "created_time": "2017-07-26T14:08:46+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1548768801810136"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548768801810136/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20280558_1548768801810136_7141820035001077593_o.jpg?oh=caefa5ce071a318ef098550254f9d6d1&oe=59FDC2EE", "created_time": "2017-07-26T14:08:46+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1548768801810136"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548464998507183/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20424105_1548464998507183_8901661319876135054_o.jpg?oh=1528747afa40471cd5cbf24e374ce2fc&oe=5A38E461", "created_time": "2017-07-26T05:48:21+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1548464998507183"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1548085178545165/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20374328_1548085178545165_669720266155291134_n.jpg?oh=9cf6e46395e072325ed093ccb2244104&oe=5A3879B5", "message": "Have a bright idea?
