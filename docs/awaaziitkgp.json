The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls.\n\nMS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the third position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category.\n\nWith the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

Same goes for IIT Patna with Rs. 8.36 crores.\n\n3) Avoidable expenditure towards penal charges on electricity consumption: IIT Madras had incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.05 crores towards penalty for exceeding contracted demand during April 2013 to March 2016 due to non-review and enhancement of sanctioned demand.\n\n4) Irregular waiver of overpayment: The Board of Governors of IIT Jodhpur irregularly waived recovery of excess payment amounting to Rs. 59.38 lakhs made to its faculty, which is now under recovery at the instance of Audit.\n\n5) Irregular reimbursement of LTC (Leave Travel Concession) claims by Central Autonomous Bodies: Central Autonomous Bodies irregularly reimbursed air fares of Rs. 6.90 crores during 2012-16 against the air tickets purchased by their employees from unauthorised agents in violation of the MoF guidelines for availing Leave Travel Concession. IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.
