Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department.\nMany a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness. We should always remember that there are still 19,706 villages in our India (Data as of 2015, Census Board, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India) which remain un-electrified even after 69 years of our independence. Around 12% of our population do not know how does it feel to spend nights with lights! \n\nWe, from Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur urge each one of us to please use the electricity and water judiciously and encourage our friends towards the same. After all, every small contribution counts!\n\n\u0938\u092e\u0930 \u0936\u0947\u0937 \u0939\u0948, \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u092a \u0915\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0917\u0940 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0927,\n\u091c\u094b \u0924\u091f\u0938\u094d\u0925 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u092f \u0932\u093f\u0916\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0909\u0928\u0915\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0927\u0964   - \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0935\u093f \u0921\u0949 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u092e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 '\u0926\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0930'", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1209137345773285/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 4 new photos.", "pic": "1209137345773285.png", "id": "146188872068143_1209156405771379"}, {"created_time": "2016-09-06T19:30:03+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1208699102483776", "message": "OPEN IIT ENGLISH ELOCUTION\nThe event was organised from 7 pm to 9.30 pm in F-116.
