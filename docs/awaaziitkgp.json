The main reasons behind this hike are stated below.\n 1.One of the major reason behind this hike is the 7th pay commission. As a result of which the salaries of both the HMC and contractual sweeping staffs have been increased. The salary of temporary workers has increased from Rs.278 per day to Rs.350 per day. \n2.One more reason behind this hike is the new policy of Tax and wage sharing. Currently, all students bear the cost towards salary and benefits of HMC employees and all outsourced sweeping workers.

This amount is used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards,coolers, roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls were not able to cope with all of these with just a small amount of 300. Also, there is an increment in the comprehensive menu in all the halls to Rs. 95 per person.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, all Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members. The main reasons behind this hike are stated below.\n 1.One of the major reason behind this hike is the 7th pay commission. As a result of which the salaries of both the HMC and contractual sweeping staffs have been increased. The salary of temporary workers has increased from Rs.278 per day to Rs.350 per day. \n2.One more reason behind this hike is the new policy of Tax and wage sharing. Currently, all students bear the cost towards salary and benefits of HMC employees and all outsourced sweeping workers. It has been decided that the salary of all private mess workers and tax on food served in private messes should as well be shared by all students so that those staying in halls with private mess are not disadvantaged.\n3. There is also an increase in the HOH from 300 to 600. This amount is used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards,coolers, roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls were not able to cope with all of these with just a small amount of 300. Also, there is an increment in the comprehensive menu in all the halls to Rs. 95 per person. So, due to these factors, the HOH has increased from 300 to 600.\n\nKeeping these things in mind, here is our 5th \u201cpoll of the week\u201d.\n\u201cWhat are your views on the recent hike in the Hostel Overhead Charge (HOH) and Hall Establishment Charge (HEC)?\u201d\nWe\u2019ll be presenting the results of this poll to the administration, so do participate and let everyone know how justified it is.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, All Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members.\n\nWe would like to thank Ksheera Sagar, a member of Students' Senate for explaining the increase in the fee.\n\n\"The main reason is for the increase is the 7th pay commission. The money [7950 per sem per student ] from all students is used to pay salaries of all HMC staff [297 in number] and all sweeping workers in all halls [nearly 500 in number],& to purchase all the sweeping and cleaning materials for all halls. As a result of the  pay commission, all the salaries were increased of both the HMC staff and also the contractual sweeping staff . The major chunk of the increment is due to the hike in salaries. Another component of the hike is due to the new policy of  TAX sharing and wage sharing. That means in the old policy[till now] the food tax on the food in private mess and the salary of the private mess workers in private mess were used to bear by private mess students only and also the private mess students used to bear the salary burden of HMC staff and sweeping staff as usual while the students at HMC mess use to bear only salaries of HMC staff , sweeping workers and sweeping materials. So in the policy [till now] the students at HMC mess were at an upper hand as they were not sharing any wages of private mess workers nor the HMC mess food has tax. This advantage ultimately led to the uplift of HMC meeses where comparatively good quality food is served than private messes. So according to the new policy, the tax of food in private mess will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private, the Mess workers salaries[HMC & private] will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private. and the sweeping workers salary , sweeping materials cost will be bear as usual. So the pay commission and the new policy of TAX and wage sharing makes the 7950 to 15200.\n\nThe HOH has also been increased from 300 to 600\n\nThis amount is called HOH[hall overhead fund], this is in general used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards, coolers , roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls with boarders strength less than 350 cannot do all the maintenance work with the HOH amount[300] obtained every sem from the students and the bigger halls with strength greater than 450 fell short in creating new facilities for their boarders like new courts, new instruments etc. So keeping all this in vision the money from 300 to 600 is increased. The HOH in every hall is controlled by warden so its allotment for maintenance and  development of the hall is entirely on the discretion of the warden."}, {"id": "146188872068143_1301416723212013", "created_time": "2016-12-07T03:50:55+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15403726_1301416723212013_4773174692037490929_o.jpg?oh=569019cc0abf9a67e3a6bb23c05c1d24&oe=58F480B2", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1301416723212013/?type=3", "message": "As per the recent circular of Hall Management Centre (HMC), all students are informed that the Hostel Overhead Charge (HOH) which is being collected from each student during semester registration has been renamed and the total fee under this category has been increased from Rs. 8,250 to Rs. 15,800.
