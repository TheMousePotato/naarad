It has proven itself to be more complex and overloaded than string theory and sure has taken away the sleep of many young people.\n\nCarrying forward the series 'aap ki raay', the results of the third poll showcase the factors prioritized by students while choosing a career. Evidently, a lion's share of the students aren't sure about their career goals and are still exploring the possible options. A little more than one-sixth felt that running after money is the need of the hour and is fairly justified to do so.\n\nAbout 18% are following their interests, ignoring factors such as job security and others whereas about 7% are blindly following the herd. Just the 1% are working on their own startup ideas and have opted out of campus placements. Another 8% have planned for higher studies including options like an MS or a PhD degree, IAS, etc. and have as well opted out of campus placements.
