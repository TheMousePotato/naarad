I, along with 60 of my friends, had a great time and a wonderful journey.\n\nEverything from management and competitions to the concerts was worthy of appreciation. All the coordinators were helpful and professional. \n\nThe campus itself is beautiful and the cleanliness is something to behold. Looking forward to visit again.\""}]
