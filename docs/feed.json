Slowly and steadily, the news broke out and KGPians were all excited to get a glimpse of the rising star of Indian Comedy i.e., Zakir Khan, popularly known as \"Sakht Launda\" whose heart never melts, no matter what!  <br>  <br> In a unique and first of its own kind of initiative, Vice President (Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur) i.e., Mayank Srivastava under the tutelage of TSG had contacted Zakir Khan requesting him to pay a visit to our campus. And he accepted it gleefully. There have been incidents of many celebrities visiting the campus but this one was something that KGP has never witnessed before! You come out of your room and take a stroll towards the entrance gate only to find Zakir Khan in front of you! You rub your eyes in disbelief but finally, you realize that it's reality! Needless to say, this has been an epic experience for many. <br>  <br> He visited Nehru Hall of Residence and interacted with students. A lot of funny moments and light conversations followed. Students were visibly excited and pleased to the core. Zakir didn't let the moment slip and tried his hands on bat-ball making it a \"moment-hai-bhai-moment-hai\" moment! There were plans to visit LLR hall as well but unfortunately, he wasn't able to. <br> Though he was here for a short period of time, he left behind smiles on hundreds of faces and that's what was the motive behind this initiative. In last one year, our campus has seen some unfortunate events happening and this was the perfect plan to boost the dampening spirit of the people. <br>  <br> We would like to thank all the stakeholders who were involved in this, especially VP, TSG who put all their efforts to execute this idea. We, on the behalf of entire campus, would also like to thank Zakir Khan from the core of our hearts for taking out some time of his busy schedule and making this campus livelier with his presence.", "real_date": "05-09-2017", "created_time": "2017-09-05T04:25:00+0000", "flag": 1, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1585006634853019/?type=3", "real_time": "09:55AM", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21316320_1585006634853019_7923472083901736591_o.jpg?oh=412e10a2244b7882178b7d963a63891c&oe=5A216E1A", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 5 new photos.", "id": "146188872068143_1585010204852662", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur"}, {"link": "https://goo.gl/forms/zsETyaB17181XfCq1", "real_date": "05-09-2017", "created_time": "2017-09-05T00:30:00+0000", "real_time": "06:00AM", "flag": 1, "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "pic": null, "id": "146188872068143_1585056804848002", "message": "OPEN IIT 2017-18 || DUMB CHARADES    <br> The Open IIT Dumb Charades Competition is scheduled to be held on 7th September in F-127 from 6:30 pm onwards.

For qualification, they had submitted a video in the month of February and qualified for the final event. <br> RoboCup is an annual international robotics competition proposed and founded in 1997 with the aim of promoting robotics and AI research, by offering a publicly appealing, but formidable challenge. This year RoboCup was held in Nagoya, Japan. They participated in two leagues in RoboCup - Small Sized League and Humanoid Simulation League. <br> This year, it was their first participation in the Small Sized League and they faced a lot of technical difficulties. A total of twenty-four teams had qualified for the league, out of which only twenty could finally make it to the league. The twenty teams were divided into four groups. From each group, first two teams on the basis of performance were selected for the quarter finals. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t make it to the quarters.  <br> In the humanoid simulation league, it was their second participation. They stood 8th among 13 teams. They were able to defeat 5 different teams in one to one matches. They won a total of 7 matches, drew 3 and were in the quarter finals. They missed the chance to go to the semi finals by just one match! <br> Next year, the RoboCup will be held in Montreal, Canada.

In the past week you might have been glued to the notice boards of your halls, or rather they would have been glued with posters introducing a multitude of different societies and groups. Every society puts up a great effort just to capture a part of that board space, to ultimately capture your eye and even more to sell themselves to you later on. Before any narcissism creeps in, we would like to point out the importance of the existence of this plethora of opportunities out there. For starters, the sheer number of these societies is what differentiates KGP from the rest of the IITs. Topping that, over time, each of these societies have turned into hubs of creativity, intellectual might, cutting-edge research, sources of valuable insights and more than anything else, a great place to make friends and forge bonds that last forever.   <br>  <br> Hence we would like to bring to your notice a little project we did.

It can be installed at any place where cleanliness needs to be monitored at regular intervals. At present, these public facilities are generally cleaned at fixed intervals, irrespective of how dirty they are. <br> The device has been developed using an embedded platform incorporated with sensors that are connected via the Internet of Things (IoT). \u201cThis monitor using sensors detects the level of hygiene in a room and through cloud sends data to the stakeholders,\u201d Prof. Routray said, adding that the setup cost for a 20-sq ft area would be less than Rs 5,000. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href=\"http://m.economictimes.com/news/science/iit-kharagpur-develops-low-cost-cleaning-technology/amp_articleshow/59852497.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> http://m.economictimes.co... </a>  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the entire team for their accomplishment!"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/tlsiitkgp/photos/a.273745919308910.84567.273738259309676/1845958795420940/?type=3", "real_date": "01-08-2017", "created_time": "2017-08-01T08:57:36+0000", "real_time": "02:27PM", "flag": 1, "source": "Technology Literary Society", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20431468_1845958795420940_7112102139388465182_n.jpg?oh=706186e7557567983d7512269a87a51a&oe=5A5A5087", "id": "273738259309676_1845959302087556", "message": "Rate?

As of now, 4,500 seats (38%) remain vacant out of 13,012 seats. To address the problem, the ministry has decided to allow faculty working under central autonomous bodies to join IITs.  <br> Interestingly, the recently set up IITs in Tirupati, Bhilai, Goa, Dharwad, Jammu and Dhanbad (formerly Indian School of Mines) have seen no dropouts.

The Entrepreneurial ventures of students  have a diversified range which generally come with an efficacious way to help out people and foster the culture of innovation.  <br>  <br> Prazium, by Enactus, IIT Kharagpur is one such Entrepreneurial action, which has won the 6th edition of the Saint Gobain Scholarship of Rs.1,00,000 for it's initial development, which was supported by Ethos so as to find a solution to the structural design problems faced today, using sustainable and eco-friendly methods. Hitesh Vyas, a 4th year architecture student, as one of the members of Enactus, presented the project in the National level competition held in May 2017 which was declared the winner of the scholarship. It tends to reduce the cost of construction and develop houses by using processed Bamboo as a replacement for steel reinforcements.  <br> Professor Damodar Maity of the Civil Engineering Department of IIT Kharagpur helped with the background research for this development.  <br>  <br> Prazium is an indigenous project in collaboration with the concrete laboratories at IIT Kharagpur and some of the prototypes have been practiced in the IIT Kharagpur\u2019s campus itself. It now aims to provide the new development to the nearby rural areas to the campus and eventually expand throughout the country.  <br>  <br> The Scholars\u2019 Avenue congratulates the Prazium team for their achievement and wishes them the best of luck for their future endeavors."}, {"link": "http://www.irishevowners.ie/", "real_date": "26-07-2017", "created_time": "2017-07-25T18:34:32+0000", "real_time": "12:04AM", "flag": 1, "source": "Electric Vehicle Group", "pic": null, "id": "1014112635344305_1458573534231544", "message": "Interested in electric vehicles in Ireland: The Irish EV Owners Association website and FaceBook Page: "}, {"message": "In a unique initiative of its own kind, Institute administration has planned an induction programme for the incoming freshers and it speaks volumes about the kind of serious efforts that the authorities are making for the welfare of the students.

Same goes for IIT Patna with Rs. 8.36 crores. <br>  <br> 3) Avoidable expenditure towards penal charges on electricity consumption: IIT Madras had incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.05 crores towards penalty for exceeding contracted demand during April 2013 to March 2016 due to non-review and enhancement of sanctioned demand. <br>  <br> 4) Irregular waiver of overpayment: The Board of Governors of IIT Jodhpur irregularly waived recovery of excess payment amounting to Rs. 59.38 lakhs made to its faculty, which is now under recovery at the instance of Audit. <br>  <br> 5) Irregular reimbursement of LTC (Leave Travel Concession) claims by Central Autonomous Bodies: Central Autonomous Bodies irregularly reimbursed air fares of Rs. 6.90 crores during 2012-16 against the air tickets purchased by their employees from unauthorised agents in violation of the MoF guidelines for availing Leave Travel Concession. IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.

But when will we get there, and how will we get there? <br>   <br> Two terms for the transition have become standard in the auto industry. There's the \"evolutionary\" path to autonomous vehicles, where today's cars get self-driving features bit by bit \u2014 Tesla's autopilot feature, for example. And then there's the \"revolutionary\" path. That's where totally self-driving cars, like the ones Google is working on, start as test vehicles and become more mainstream as they can drive in more places. <br> There's an ongoing debate over which path is the safer one. But these paths will eventually converge. <br>   <br> Today's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed. <br>   <br> This tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are \"platooning\" trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. A \"pilot\" truck drives while those behind can sit and relax. <br>  <br> Google and Ford are testing self-driving cars in structured environments like test tracks, as well as cities with relatively light traffic, like Austin, Texas and Mountain View, Calif. Vehicles travel at slow speeds \u2014 up to 25 miles an hour \u2014 while gathering data on pedestrians and human drivers; they are also starting to drive at night, and in rain and snow. <br>   <br> By 2019, Driver-assistance features will get more sophisticated, and will sync up with GPS and navigation. So a driver should be able to input a destination while driving on a highway, turn on adaptive cruise control and let the car drive itself. When it gets to the appropriate exit, the car will return control to the driver. <br>  <br> In the USA, NHTSA (NATIONAL HIGHWAYS TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION) has begun working on rules for testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, without a driver, across the country. In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails <br> . <br> Companies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic.  <br>   <br> Commercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways.  <br>   <br> Here is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations : <br>   <br>  <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.wired.com/sto... </a> "}, {"message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users will flock to buy the current version, although previous versions are still well in use.
