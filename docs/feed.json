The saga of waking up just 5 minutes before class is an everlasting one with consequences that might lead to cycle collisions thanks to some of the new changes in rules around here.

Scaling the peak of the most coveted institute in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is everybody's dream. Getting admission into MIT is an objectively quantified pinnacle of achievement.  <br>  <br> Well, that explains the rat race we were put into from a very young age, right?
