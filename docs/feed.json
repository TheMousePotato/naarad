An excerpt: A democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have the right to equal participation, either directly or through elected representatives, in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. To put it in very simple terms, it is a form of government where people choose their own government and the voice of the majority rules. Once the majority is established, the minority has no say. Even in a republic, it's the voice of the majority that rules through chosen representatives; however, there is a charter or constitution of basic rights that protects the minority from being completely unrepresented or overridden.  <br>  <a href=\"http://www.diffen.com/difference/Democracy_vs_Republic\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.diffen.com/dif... </a> ", "real_time": "09:32AM", "created_time": "2017-01-26T04:02:08+0000", "source": "The Scholar's Avenue", "id": "156819310131_10154837562400132"}, {"real_date": "26-01-2017", "source": "The Scholar's Avenue", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16174567_1701369873487437_2574974371335785572_n.jpg?oh=bfb4ac7fd7c2a7cf14aa1f4f1334f79b&oe=591F3232", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/director.iitkgp/photos/a.1460899854201108.1073741828.1455755204715573/1701369873487437/?type=3", "flag": 1, "message": "<b>The Scholars' Avenue shared Director IIT Kharagpur's photo.</b> <br>  <br> Prof Ajoy Kumar Ray, Professor of IIT Kharagpur and currently Director of IIEST Shibpur awarded Padma Shri.

He disappeared from his hall, the Radha Krishnan Hall of Residence, on Sunday, reportedly after calling his mother and stating his wish to die, switching off his phone right after the call. Alarmed, his mother had informed his friends triggering a campus wide search. His body was found by the officials on Monday morning, in front of a train track some 20 kms away from our campus. <br> His friends and well wishers said he showed no signs of suicide, although he did tackle with depression and anxiety. A recent detection of tuberculosis and an alleged quarrel with his family on some issue might have pushed him to take such an extreme step, reports suggest. <br> Lokesh was and always will fondly be remembered as a studious and joyful soul. It is still a shock to the KGP community that incidents of suicide keep plaguing our hallowed institute. Such an extreme decision doesn't take a day to materialise. <br> We regret the death of a fellow KGPian, which was uncalled for, and also urge everyone of you to keep a close check on any unusual behaviors you might observe among those close to you. <br> May his soul rest in peace!", "real_time": "02:23PM", "created_time": "2017-01-17T08:53:05+0000", "source": "The Scholar's Avenue", "id": "156819310131_10154806981175132"}, {"real_date": "17-01-2017", "source": "The Scholar's Avenue", "pic": null, "link": "http://m.indiatoday.in/story/iit-reservation-seats-girl-students-panel-suggestion/1/858179.html", "flag": 1, "message": "<b>The Scholars' Avenue shared their post.</b> <br>  <br> There has been a slump in the number of girl students entering into IITs in the recent years.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, all Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members. The main reasons behind this hike are stated below. <br>  1.One of the major reason behind this hike is the 7th pay commission. As a result of which the salaries of both the HMC and contractual sweeping staffs have been increased. The salary of temporary workers has increased from Rs.278 per day to Rs.350 per day.  <br> 2.One more reason behind this hike is the new policy of Tax and wage sharing. Currently, all students bear the cost towards salary and benefits of HMC employees and all outsourced sweeping workers. It has been decided that the salary of all private mess workers and tax on food served in private messes should as well be shared by all students so that those staying in halls with private mess are not disadvantaged. <br> 3. There is also an increase in the HOH from 300 to 600. This amount is used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards,coolers, roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls were not able to cope with all of these with just a small amount of 300. Also, there is an increment in the comprehensive menu in all the halls to Rs. 95 per person. So, due to these factors, the HOH has increased from 300 to 600. <br>  <br> We would like to thanks Ksheera Sagar, a member of Student's senate for insights on the hike. <br> Keeping these things in mind, here is our 5th \u201cpoll of the week\u201d. <br> \u201cWhat are your views on the recent hike in the Hostel Overhead Charge (HOH) and Hall Establishment Charge (HEC)?\u201d <br> We\u2019ll be presenting the results of this poll to the administration, so do participate and let everyone know how justified it is.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, All Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members. <br>  <br> We would like to thank Ksheera Sagar, a member of Students' Senate for explaining the increase in the fee. <br>  <br> \"The main reason is for the increase is the 7th pay commission. The money [7950 per sem per student ] from all students is used to pay salaries of all HMC staff [297 in number] and all sweeping workers in all halls [nearly 500 in number],& to purchase all the sweeping and cleaning materials for all halls. As a result of the  pay commission, all the salaries were increased of both the HMC staff and also the contractual sweeping staff . The major chunk of the increment is due to the hike in salaries. Another component of the hike is due to the new policy of  TAX sharing and wage sharing. That means in the old policy[till now] the food tax on the food in private mess and the salary of the private mess workers in private mess were used to bear by private mess students only and also the private mess students used to bear the salary burden of HMC staff and sweeping staff as usual while the students at HMC mess use to bear only salaries of HMC staff , sweeping workers and sweeping materials. So in the policy [till now] the students at HMC mess were at an upper hand as they were not sharing any wages of private mess workers nor the HMC mess food has tax. This advantage ultimately led to the uplift of HMC meeses where comparatively good quality food is served than private messes. So according to the new policy, the tax of food in private mess will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private, the Mess workers salaries[HMC & private] will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private. and the sweeping workers salary , sweeping materials cost will be bear as usual. So the pay commission and the new policy of TAX and wage sharing makes the 7950 to 15200. <br>  <br> The HOH has also been increased from 300 to 600 <br>  <br> This amount is called HOH[hall overhead fund], this is in general used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards, coolers , roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls with boarders strength less than 350 cannot do all the maintenance work with the HOH amount[300] obtained every sem from the students and the bigger halls with strength greater than 450 fell short in creating new facilities for their boarders like new courts, new instruments etc. So keeping all this in vision the money from 300 to 600 is increased. The HOH in every hall is controlled by warden so its allotment for maintenance and  development of the hall is entirely on the discretion of the warden.", "real_time": "06:57PM", "created_time": "2016-12-07T13:27:22+0000", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "id": "146188872068143_1302107379809614"}, {"real_date": "07-12-2016", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1301416723212013/?type=3", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15403726_1301416723212013_4773174692037490929_o.jpg?oh=569019cc0abf9a67e3a6bb23c05c1d24&oe=58F480B2", "flag": 1, "message": "As per the recent circular of Hall Management Centre (HMC), all students are informed that the Hostel Overhead Charge (HOH) which is being collected from each student during semester registration has been renamed and the total fee under this category has been increased from Rs. 8,250 to Rs. 15,800.

We sat down with him to discuss the initiatives taken by the center and how beneficial it is for the student community. <br>  <br> The Center has recently been catapulted into the public view with its highly publicized workshop on happiness which saw participation from eminent personality, most notably Ms. Sonja Lyubomirsky, the author of How of Happiness and R. Gopalakrishnan, the former director of TATA Sons Ltd. The workshop is among the first of many initiatives taken by the center. For now  , the center aims at focusing on the first year students and the final years who face a great deal of stress while adjusting to the new environment and coping up with the pressure of placements respectively. They have collaborated with Gymkhana and CDC and are planning on conducting various kinds of workshops for this purpose.   <br>     <br> Elaborating on the course structure Professor Patnaik  explained  it to be a short one, over a period of two weeks, and through 10 hours of lectures and about 5 hours of interaction and activities, which  will attempt to (a) understand happiness scientifically, and (b) develop a hands-on experience by exploring its various components through introspection, experience, psychometric measures, physiological measures and other scientific tools. He even talked about a survey that was conducted amongst the UG and PG students. The findings of this survey indicated a huge gap between what the students want to do and what they actually end up doing. They realized that this could be the starting point of all the unhappiness amongst the students.   A lot of alumni have  been included in the project to share their experience. According to them, work life  balance is very essential. Extra curricular activities, where people are not evaluated play an important role in having a balanced life. Which is why they even had the science of happiness challenge. Three projects on community service were selected. Two were student groups and the other was a community group .Each got  RS.30,000 to do something in the next few months and bring about a change in the IIT community. The center is looking forward to doing it every year and has also planned on  roping  in CSR and corporate health resources to get a pool of more money.    <br> Next semester they are planning   on  a couple of electives. \"The goal of the director as well as Mr. Rekhi is that by 2017 autumn semester we have a micro -specialization of The science of happiness .So we are targeting that by July 2017 we will have an array of courses, on its different components like positive psychology, self- introspection, resilience and character building . \" said Professor Patnaik. On being asked about the career opportunities that the students will be exposed to after taking up the course he said , \"We have many students who after going out will start exploring will switch and move into another area or will start integrating the two. Career opportunities and impact of the courses will be in two different ways. First one is that implementation of these in various kinds of organizational   and administrative positions. And the other one would be that we could, later on use this micro- specialization to explore further and study deeper into the area.\"  <br> He also commented on the previous attempts made to quantify happiness regarding which he said, \u201cThere are a few tools which may use certain parameters to quantify happiness. These can be tricky and will have to be used with caution. If somebody sees that my happiness index shows that I am unhappy, and that kind of sets the entire ball rolling and that is not how it should be and that is now how it is. That would be against the ground rules set for the course. But in the end  , I would like to say these are only subjective   indicators . We definitely use a lot of statistics for these indicators. \u201c   <br> They have also planned to expand the outreach of the center and have already been approached by the psychiatrists at Tata Medical who were very keen on discussing   the increasing stress levels among students. <br>  <br> The registration for this course has already begun. It is a one credit course and will run from 1st to 12th November this semester. Eminent Prof. of Psychology, Prof. Manas K. Mandal will lead the team of faculty who will offer this course. Interested participants may visit ERP in order to register: <br> Academic --   Students  --   Micro Credit Registration (choose the course: Introduction to the Science of Happiness) <br>  <br> The course can take a  maximum  of  100 students on the basis of pre-registration and interest. Registration will close on 27th October.

Fondly remembered by many students and admirers. <br>  <br> Amherst - Madhukar Anant Rege passed away at age 92, on September 20th, 2016, after a long illness and a long, full life on three continents. <br>  <br> Born in Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast of India, he had a happy, active childhood. From an early age he loved drawing and painting and eventually earned a Diploma in Architecture at the J.J. School of Art in Bombay, after apprenticing for a year with the master watercolorist Sawlaram Haldankar. In 1949, at age 25, he set sail for England with the help of his eldest brother Vinayak, where he successfully sat the R.I.B.A. (Royal Institute of British Architects) examination and then completed a post-graduate Diploma in Town Planning. <br>  <br> It was in England that he met and married Gladys Sharp on July 4th, 1953, and, after the birth of their first daughter in 1954, returned to India, where he took up a lectureship in Architecture at the newly formed Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, West Bengal. He was to stay at I.I.T. for 14 years, aside from a year's leave in London and a three-year period in Athens, Greece where he worked with the pioneering Doxiadis Associates, after which he returned to Kharagpur as Professor and Head of the Department of Architecture and City Planning. <br>  <br> In 1969 he migrated to the United States, first as a SPURS (Special Program for Urban and Regional Studies) Fellow at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then as a city planner for the City of Newton and eventually as a planner for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Communities and Development, where he worked in the Main Street Program on downtown revitalization of Mass. cities and towns. He also lectured at the Boston Architectural Center. When his wife and daughters joined him in 1970, he moved first to Brookline, then to Newton, and, upon retirement in 1993, settled with Gladys in Amherst. After retirement he returned to his first passion, painting, which he had kept up throughout his life, filling his home with beauty. <br>  <br> He was a true Renaissance man: a lifelong reader, always with his head in a book, but also an avid gardener. For many years he practiced yoga regularly. He made toys for his children and most of the furniture for his family, taught himself leatherwork, loved philosophical and political discussions, music, swimming, tennis, and cooking, and was a staunch Democrat, making sure to vote, by absentee ballot, even during his last illness. <br>  <br> He leaves behind Gladys, his loving wife of 63 years; daughters Josna Rege, in Amherst and Sally Rege Carroll, in North Reading, Massachusetts; grandsons Nikhil, in New York City, and Tyler, also from North Reading, currently studying at UMass Amherst; sisters Kumud Rege and Sunita Kulkarni, and brothers Prabhakar and Sadanand Rege, all in Mumbai, India; sons-in-law Andrew and Kevin, many loving nieces and nephews, brothers- and sisters-in law, and fast friends in India, England, and the United States.

Despite the introduction of several savings and alternative measures like replacement of traditional halogen street lamps with LED, sensor operated lights and installation of solar panels, this sharp upswing whereas can be attributed to an increase in research facilities and functioning of four new halls viz. RLB, LBS, BRH & NVH; it cannot be ruled out completely that the misuse and wastage do not have a colossal rise. The hall and department wise data obtained from the Electric Office unveils that the consumption has increased drastically in almost every hall and department. <br> Many a times we are seen to leave the lights and fans running while we go to the class; not because of our unwillingness but because of our carelessness.

The saga of waking up just 5 minutes before class is an everlasting one with consequences that might lead to cycle collisions thanks to some of the new changes in rules around here.

Scaling the peak of the most coveted institute in the world, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is everybody's dream. Getting admission into MIT is an objectively quantified pinnacle of achievement.  <br>  <br> Well, that explains the rat race we were put into from a very young age, right?
