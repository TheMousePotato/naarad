For qualification, they had submitted a video in the month of February and qualified for the final event. <br> RoboCup is an annual international robotics competition proposed and founded in 1997 with the aim of promoting robotics and AI research, by offering a publicly appealing, but formidable challenge. This year RoboCup was held in Nagoya, Japan. They participated in two leagues in RoboCup - Small Sized League and Humanoid Simulation League. <br> This year, it was their first participation in the Small Sized League and they faced a lot of technical difficulties. A total of twenty-four teams had qualified for the league, out of which only twenty could finally make it to the league. The twenty teams were divided into four groups. From each group, first two teams on the basis of performance were selected for the quarter finals. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t make it to the quarters.  <br> In the humanoid simulation league, it was their second participation. They stood 8th among 13 teams. They were able to defeat 5 different teams in one to one matches. They won a total of 7 matches, drew 3 and were in the quarter finals. They missed the chance to go to the semi finals by just one match! <br> Next year, the RoboCup will be held in Montreal, Canada. We hope for a better performance and even better results in the upcoming RoboCup. <br> Link to Competition website:  <a href=\"https://www.robocup2017.org\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.robocup2017.o... </a> / <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the entire team for their stupendous efforts and commendable performance!

In the past week you might have been glued to the notice boards of your halls, or rather they would have been glued with posters introducing a multitude of different societies and groups. Every society puts up a great effort just to capture a part of that board space, to ultimately capture your eye and even more to sell themselves to you later on. Before any narcissism creeps in, we would like to point out the importance of the existence of this plethora of opportunities out there. For starters, the sheer number of these societies is what differentiates KGP from the rest of the IITs. Topping that, over time, each of these societies have turned into hubs of creativity, intellectual might, cutting-edge research, sources of valuable insights and more than anything else, a great place to make friends and forge bonds that last forever.   <br>  <br> Hence we would like to bring to your notice a little project we did.

The responsibility will be on the institute to help students find a suitable industry for the internship,\u201d Union HRD minister Javadekar was quoted as telling the Lok Sabha on Monday. The responsibility will be on the institute to help students find a suitable industry for the internship. <br> His statements come in the context of AICTE data from 2015-2016 which asserted that in 10,328 technical institutes, only 6.96 lakh students got campus placements out of 15.87 lakh students. <br> Meanwhile, the teachers of engineering institutes will have to take up online courses offered on government\u2019s SWAYAM portal. \u201cEvery teacher in each of the technical discipline shall mandatorily undergo an annual refresher course through SWAYAM portal (Massive open online course), encapsulating all advances in their field of study,\u201d the minister said. <br> However, it'll be interesting to see when are these decisions going to get formulated and transformed into action. This, if implemented, is surely expected to cause a huge turnaround in the field of engineering education. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href=\"https://www.thequint.com/education/2017/07/26/three-internships-mandatory-for-engineering-students-says-javadekar\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.thequint.com/... </a> ", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1548905741796442/?type=3", "real_date": "26-07-2017", "real_time": "10:34PM", "id": "146188872068143_1548916871795329", "created_time": "2017-07-26T17:04:40+0000", "flag": 1, "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20287201_1548905741796442_8236007610726082548_o.jpg?oh=218185e8493376f016eb2bcbcf8caba7&oe=5A32D192", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur"}, {"story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "real_time": "07:38PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548768801810136/?type=3", "real_date": "26-07-2017", "id": "146188872068143_1548768801810136", "created_time": "2017-07-26T14:08:46+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20280558_1548768801810136_7141820035001077593_o.jpg?oh=caefa5ce071a318ef098550254f9d6d1&oe=59FDC2EE", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur"}, {"story": "Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur shared Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's photo.", "id": "149405445074499_1764371366911224", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iitkgp.alumnicell/photos/a.367054666668106.87174.121094537930788/1731369123569980/?type=3", "real_date": "26-07-2017", "real_time": "05:56PM", "message": "<b>Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur shared Alumni Cell, IIT Kharagpur's photo.</b> <br>  <br> Attention 2nd year students! <br> Are you ready to get aboard with us for one of the most enriching experiences in KGP! <br>  <br> Students' Alumni Cell is recruiting Student Members, Public Relations Team (Design and Photography & Videography Team) and Web team.  <br>  <br> Register on the link :  <a href=\"https://goo.gl/8q93h7\" target=\"_blank\"> https://goo.gl/8q93h7 </a>  <br> The deadline for the registrations is 27th July, 2017 till midnight. <br> To know more about us, check out  <a href=\"http://www.sac.iitkgp.ac.in\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sac.iitkgp.ac.... </a> /", "created_time": "2017-07-26T12:26:23+0000", "flag": 1, "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20247736_1731369123569980_3998699703649170046_o.jpg?oh=742abcf78c4617dd099eb8ac36dd55f0&oe=59F11DA5", "source": "Technology Students Gymkhana"}, {"story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "real_time": "11:18AM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548464998507183/?type=3", "real_date": "26-07-2017", "id": "146188872068143_1548464998507183", "created_time": "2017-07-26T05:48:21+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20424105_1548464998507183_8901661319876135054_o.jpg?oh=1528747afa40471cd5cbf24e374ce2fc&oe=5A38E461", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur"}, {"message": "Have a bright idea?

IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.
